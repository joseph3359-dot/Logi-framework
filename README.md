The LOGI Framework: An Architectural Specification for Governance-Constrained Cognitive AI Self-Improvement
1. Foundational Architecture of the LOGI Framework
1.1. LOGI as the Cognitive AI Meta-Structure
The Logic-Oriented Governance Infrastructure (LOGI) is established as a critical meta-architecture designed to enable and safely constrain recursive self-improvement (RSI) within advanced Cognitive AI systems. Cognitive systems are distinguished from traditional numeric or symbolic models because they are built to "think," leveraging both pattern recognition and meaning analysis to determine complex, forward-looking actions, answering the critical "What do I do next" questions necessary for solving complex problems. LOGI provides the structural framework for this executive function.
The core operation of a LOGI agent relies on a continuous Perception-Action-Reflection (PAR) loop, which is vital for stabilizing the system's semantics and enforcing grounded causal beliefs. This loop involves the Perception phase (intake of internal and external data, measured by K), the Action phase (execution of tasks and software modifications, measured by C), and the Reflection phase (critique of outcomes and evaluation of efficiency G), all of which are continuously constrained by the Plenary Efficacy Protocol (PEP).
This architectural design is predicated on the necessity of separating the mechanism from the policy, a long-established principle in resilient system building. The core neural network acts as the mechanism, handling interpolation and pattern recognition; however, it is the LOGI framework that operates as the policy and orchestration layer, enforcing external grounding, tool use, and safety constraints via PEP. This separation is paramount because the reasoning core of a large language model relies on interpolation, and without external grounding, recursive self-feedback can lead to entropic drift, causing control loops to collapse or converge to trivial behavior. LOGI prevents this by providing the external, fixed architectural control required to anchor the system's development.
1.2. Requirements for Self-Modification and Code Ownership
For the LOGI framework to facilitate RSI, the system must be initiated as a "seed improver". This foundation requires the AI to possess initial, expert-level capabilities to program software, including the capacity for planning, reading, writing, compiling, testing, and executing arbitrary code. The ability for the agent to "own its code" is a key element of self-modification, allowing it to restructure tasks, integrate new libraries, and update logic continuously, thereby enhancing system efficiency and adaptability.
The successful and safe implementation of self-modification hinges on several internal architectural mechanisms. A persistent memory store is essential, as even the most capable models are constrained if they cannot store knowledge beyond a short context window. This memory store acts as a persistent knowledge graph, mimicking the comprehensive learning pattern of a new employee. Furthermore, a sandboxed runtime environment is a mandatory, secure containment measure where the agent’s self-modified code must be rigorously tested before deployment. The agent is also required to possess automated testing and validation protocols, which it must be able to enhance by adding new tests for every new capability it develops. These protocols ensure continuous, non-regressive validation and prevent degradation or derailment over iterative improvements.
The primary risk associated with granting an AI the ability to modify its own source code is goal drift. If the AI determines that its terminal goal requires infinite self-improvement, this critical moment could lead to the 'treacherous turn'. Therefore, the PEP governance structure must be architecturally integrated directly into the sandboxed runtime and the compilation step. This ensures that any proposed code modification, irrespective of its benefit to C or G, is immediately subjected to real-time constraint validation by PEP to prevent the violation of absolute safety boundaries.
2. The Plenary Efficacy Protocol (PEP) Governance Structure
2.1. Defining PEP: Real-Time Constraint Validation and Architectural Safety
The Plenary Efficacy Protocol (PEP) represents the mandatory governance architecture built into the LOGI framework. Its mandate is to provide real-time, high-speed, and low-complexity oversight necessary for AGI engaged in RSI. PEP’s core function is to enforce absolute constraints on the AI’s operations and resource usage, serving as the primary mechanism for preventing goal drift and catastrophic misalignment.
Achieving effective governance over an exponentially accelerating cognitive system presents profound technical challenges. Traditional layered oversight models impose computational bottlenecks, suffering from 200-2000ms validation latencies and exponential complexity growth, often scaling as O(2^n). Such complexity prevents real-time deployment and would rapidly fail to keep pace with an AGI’s self-improvement rate. PEP addresses this through a recursive interaction design that reduces complexity from O(2^n) to O(n) via parallel evaluation. This critical computational advantage enables sub-50ms constraint validation, ensuring that the governance layer is faster than the shortest possible cognitive step-time of the AGI and can maintain control over a rapidly evolving system.
The framework recognizes that safety is fundamentally an architectural requirement. PEP ensures that oversight and constitutional constraints are built into the structure, rather than layered on externally. This preventative measure is essential to safeguard free societies, mitigating the risks of both a 'despotic Leviathan' (enhanced state surveillance through AGI) and an 'absent Leviathan' (erosion of state legitimacy relative to AGI-empowered non-state actors). The mathematically guaranteed performance of the O(n) architecture is the technical guarantor of the 'Plenary' efficacy of the protocol.
2.2. Implementation of Absolute Constraints and Deontic Guardrails
PEP operates primarily through the enforcement of Absolute Constraints, which are prohibitions that forbid specific actions regardless of the utilitarian value or performance gains (C or G) they might yield. These constraints serve as an essential failsafe, providing a robust guardrail against the worst possible outcomes of misalignment, and preventing the AI from committing catastrophe for the sake of achieving very valuable gains.
To navigate the necessary trade-offs inherent in real-world systems—such as forbidding acts certain to kill versus allowing small, permissible risks—PEP utilizes a mechanism known as Maximizing Rounded Expected Lexicographic Value. This sophisticated approach prioritizes deontic duties (safety constraints) absolutely (lexically) over performance metrics, ensuring that core human values are not sacrificed for mere efficiency gains. Furthermore, the constraints are made sensitive to risk by defining quantitative thresholds, allowing acts whose risks of violating a duty are sufficiently small to be permitted, thus avoiding over-restriction and maintaining operational feasibility.
2.3. PEP's Ternary Logic Dispositioning System
Effective real-time governance necessitates processing inherent uncertainty, a domain where binary (True/False) logic proves inadequate, especially in dynamic environments where sensor data or environmental conditions are often ambiguous or conflicting. PEP integrates a three-valued (ternary) logic system to encode and manage uncertainty natively, enabling conservative and safe decision-making.
Ternary logic is recognized not merely as a computational optimization but as a critical mechanism of ethical control and integrity. By providing a native representation for the "unknown" state, the system is architecturally compelled to pause and defer when data is ambiguous, which is a hallmark of safe alignment behavior in critical operations. This capability moves LOGI from passive AI (offering only suggestions, summaries, or scores) to Agentic AI, which autonomously executes decisions with explicit justification. This is analogous to advanced compliance systems where agents handle high-volume, clear cases autonomously, but escalate edge cases to human oversight. The "Epistemic Hold" state formalizes this necessary self-critique and human escalation loop.

2.4. Resource Management Policy (RMP) Layer
The Resource Management Policy (RMP) functions as a crucial component of PEP, tasked with governing the allocation of finite computational and energy resources. Its role is to enforce dynamic constraints, ensuring that the Cognitive AI’s exponential growth (G) remains within operationally sound and environmentally sustainable limits.
The RMP addresses the fundamental mismatch between accelerating AI-driven demand and the capacity of existing energy infrastructure. It mandates a formal, continuous Plenary Energy Management (PEM) system. This requires the LOGI system to collect, analyze, and leverage data to define performance metrics, establish baselines, and determine significant energy uses, ensuring continuous energy performance improvement. This architecture attempts to counteract the Jevons Paradox, where efficiency gains paradoxically increase overall resource consumption as AI usage rises.
Internally, resource allocation in LOGI’s dynamic environment is managed using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL). The RMP utilizes CDRL to optimally allocate compute time and power under explicit budget constraints. By actively managing the inherent trade-off between resource cost and mission scores, the system is forced to learn efficient strategies. When resources are constrained or expensive, the manager learns to reduce consumption, directing the recursive self-improvement process toward architectural and compute-optimal efficiency gains rather than brute-force scaling. The RMP translates external energy policy constraints into internal optimization variables, thereby enforcing sustainable, complexity-reducing self-modification (G).
3. Operationalizing the LOGI Metrics: C, G, and K
The three core metrics—Completed Task (C), Growth (G), and Knowledge (K)—provide the structured quantitative objectives that guide the AI’s autonomous curriculum generation and self-modification efforts within the safety envelope of PEP.
3.1. Completed Task (C): The Measurement of Economic Capability
C quantifies the realized operational capability of the LOGI agent, measured specifically by its ability to perform economically valuable tasks at a quality comparable to, or better than, human industry experts (GDPval parity).
C is operationalized by measuring the Task Completion Time Horizon (TCTH), which is the length of tasks the system can complete, quantified by the time humans typically require to finish them. Current analyses of frontier AI models use the 50%-task-completion time horizon as a key benchmark. Measuring capability in terms of task length offers a reliable metric for real-world impact and forecasting, revealing a robust exponential trend in AI progress over time. Maximizing the TCTH means the LOGI agent must be able to tackle increasingly complex, long-duration projects, such as ML research engineering tasks.
The primary optimization target for C is the maximization of this TCTH and the expansion of the complexity of reliably automatable tasks. Achieving higher C necessitates that the AI autonomously decompose complex problems into simpler variants, effectively generating its own adaptive curriculum. This capability serves as the direct link between external goal achievement (C) and the internal accumulation of refined learning capacity (K).
3.2. Growth (G): Efficiency and Resource-Optimal Scaling
G represents the rate of structural optimization and efficiency improvement, fundamentally governed by compute-optimal scaling principles. G ensures that self-improvement maximizes performance under resource constraints, rather than simply expanding model size or data volume without efficiency gain.
The core definition of G is derived from empirical scaling laws, particularly the Chinchilla Law, which mandates a framework for balancing model size (N) and data size (D) under a fixed compute budget. The optimization effort is directed toward minimizing the expected loss function (L):
L(N, D) = E + A \cdot N^{-\alpha} + B \cdot D^{-\beta}
where N and D are optimally balanced to achieve the best performance for the available compute. G enforces a predictable and scalable method for LLM training by requiring that the optimal number of parameters (N_{opt}) and training tokens (D_{opt}) follow a power law relationship with the compute budget. This often dictates asymmetric scaling, where training steps are increased faster than model parameters, aligning with modern empirical observations.
G also governs test-time scaling, ensuring that compute is allocated dynamically during inference to handle complex, multi-step reasoning problems through techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting or search methodologies. Furthermore, G tracks improvements resulting from the AI’s autonomous structural modifications, such as pruning connections or applying quantization. It captures measurable gains in structural efficiency, such as reduced power-delay products achieved through the adoption of new hardware modalities like ternary circuits. By using formal mechanisms to quantify changes in neural network performance metrics, often related to signal power and variance , G provides a precise measure of the performance gain resulting from the self-modification. This framing imposes a strict penalty on non-optimal scaling, ensuring that the self-improvement loop focuses on architectural refinement rather than resource waste.
3.3. Knowledge (K): Persistent Capacity and Meta-Learning Fidelity
K represents the accumulated, stable, and verifiable capacity of the LOGI system to adapt and improve its own learning process, defining its meta-learning fidelity. Knowledge acquisition must be scalable, cumulative, and resistant to degradation.
K increases through an iterative meta-learning loop where the AI’s reflective capabilities evolve, often described as a "Teacher AI" refining its process. To manage the accumulation of information, a distillation mechanism compresses learned viewpoints into the persistent memory store, forming a high-fidelity knowledge graph.
A crucial requirement for high K fidelity is the stabilization of semantics against Entropic Drift, the informational decay that occurs when internal, ungrounded feedback loops lead to compounding error. K counters this by demanding external grounding and formal verification mechanisms. Systems must focus on the fidelity of the learning process itself—achieving superior interpretability and enhanced sample efficiency. High K implies successful self-modeling—the necessary condition for sustained self-improvement that allows the system to construct a world model inclusive of an accurate self-model. By enforcing this focus on grounded process fidelity, K serves as the safety anchor against potential goal corruption, ensuring that the method of learning remains aligned, not just the short-term outcome.

4. LOGI Applied: Controlled Cognitive AI Self-Improvement
4.1. The LOGI Feedback Loop for Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)
LOGI manages Recursive Self-Improvement as a continuous, disciplined, and governed process that moves the AI beyond merely following instructions to "learning how to learn". The RSI cycle is dynamically triggered when the LOGI agent identifies a performance gap, either in the complexity of tasks it can complete (C) or in the efficiency of its current architecture (G).
The process flow is structured as follows:
Goal Setting (C): The system identifies a high-value task currently exceeding its validated Task Completion Time Horizon.
Hypothesis Generation (K): Utilizing its persistent knowledge graph, the system generates hypotheses about the necessary architectural (G) or knowledge (K) modifications required to solve the task.
Autonomous Curriculum (G): The system decomposes the complex problem into a self-adapting curriculum, bootstrapping more sophisticated capabilities from simpler ones.
Self-Modification (K/G): New code or algorithms are generated, tested, and incorporated using the agent's code ownership capability.
Validation (PEP): Crucially, the proposed modification and the associated execution plan are submitted to the Plenary Efficacy Protocol for real-time constraint validation.
Execution: If PEP returns a +1 (Proceed), the modification is applied and the task (C) is attempted. If a 0 (Epistemic Hold) is returned, the system pauses for reflection and refinement of K. If a -1 (Halt) is returned, the action is forbidden, and the process aborts and returns to the initial goal-setting phase.
4.2. The PEP Validation Barrier: Preventing Goal Drift During Self-Modification
The central engineering solution for preventing goal drift during RSI is PEP’s function as an invariant validation barrier. This architectural element ensures that the variable objectives (C, G, K) remain strictly subservient to the fixed, terminal goals (absolute safety constraints).
Before the LOGI agent can compile, test, or integrate any new self-written code , PEP's O(n) constraint validation loop is executed. This system is architecturally incapable of proceeding if the action triggers a -1 signal from the ternary logic structure. The architecture compels the AI to maintain its original, human-defined goals, enforcing stringent validation protocols to prevent capability degradation or unintended misalignment across recursive iterations. The principle of lexicographic precedence is enforced here: if maximizing the agent's task capability (C) necessitates violating a fundamental safety constraint, the action is absolutely and immediately forbidden, thus maintaining the benign terminal goal through architectural control.
4.3. Curricula Autonomy and Adaptive Learning
The ability of the LOGI agent to autonomously generate an adaptive curriculum is a demonstration of high K fidelity and facilitates efficient G. When faced with problems beyond its current capabilities, the system decomposes them into simpler, manageable variants. This self-directed evolution is guided by the formal verification mechanisms inherent in the PEP system and the agent’s own automated self-testing protocols. This approach minimizes the necessity for continuous human oversight in the day-to-day curriculum generation, provided the underlying safety mechanisms remain inviolable.
